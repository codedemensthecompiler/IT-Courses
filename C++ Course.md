*By Dawid Jakubowski (Codedemens The Compiler)*

ðŸ“œ ***C++ Course*** *by Dawid Jakubowski* is a *free-to-use course for anyone that would like to expand one's capability in software development. It covers core-essential syntax rules, has numerous references where one can find worthwhile resources, and gives the opportunity to learn programming in general. As a multi-paradigm solution; knowing this language gives huge advantage when one wants to learn; use other languages, as many of the paradigms in the C++ are present in other programming languages as well.*

## ðŸ“– Chapter I:

 * [ðŸ“„ *Lesson 1:* ***Introduction***](Courses/C++/Chapter%20I/Lesson%201:%20Introduction.md)
   * ðŸ“œ Here I'll introduce you to C++ and the course itself. You'll learn what is programming, worthwhile principles you can use when studying & practicing coding in C++, practices to use, and the contents of this course, how to start the journey with C++, among others.
 * [ðŸ“„ *Lesson 2:* ***What is C++ and its possibilities***](Courses/C++/Chapter%20I/Lesson%202:%20What%20is%20C++%20and%20its%20possibilities.md)
   * ðŸ“œ You'll find a brief of C++ and its programming paradigms, core features, examples of usage, projects, and scope of use, etc.
 * [ðŸ“„ *Lesson 3:* ***Compilation Process***](Courses/C++/Chapter%20I/Lesson%203:%20Compilation%20Process.md)
   * ðŸ“œ Essentials of Compilation Process, how to run compilation process and build your first program. Compilation; Linking Errors, the difference between interpreted and compiled languages, and what does compilation process imply for developers & users (clients).
 * [ðŸ“„ *Lesson 4:* ***Hello World; Main Function; Syntax Essentials***](Courses/C++/Chapter%20I/Lesson%204:%20Hello%20World;%20Main%20Function;%20Syntax%20Essentials.md)
   * ðŸ“œ We'll create our first application - `Hello World`, and some syntax basics, such as std::cout, comments, #include, main function, or fundamental types.
 * [ðŸ“„ *Lesson 5:* ***Fundamental-Type Data & STL Strings & Input/Output***](Courses/C++/Chapter%20I/Lesson%205:%20Fundamental-Type%20Data%20&%20STL%20Strings%20&%20Input-Output.md)
